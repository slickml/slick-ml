.. SlickML documentation API Reference Entry Point
.. NOTES: 
   1) This is the landing page of API Reference which is mainly populated via `sphinx auto-api`. The
      automated API references lives under `<autoapi/index>`.
   2) This entry point needs maintenance for the cases that we are adding a new upper-level entry
      point. For example, currently we do not have any `clustering/` methods. Therefore, by adding
      it to the API, we need to expose it here as a new card.
