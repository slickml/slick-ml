Welcome to SlickMLðŸ§ž Documentation!
===================================

**SlickML** is an open-source machine learning library written in Python aimed
at accelerating the experimentation time for a ML application. Data Scientists'
tasks can often be repetitive such as feature selection, model tuning, or
evaluating metrics for classification and regression problems. SlickML provides
Data Scientists with a toolbox to quickly prototype solutions for a given problem with minimal code.

.. TODO(amir): update this pages one-by-one and add to the main doc
   1) Each page needs more attention to change the markdowns into sphinx codes
   2) We might need to add more `.rst` files under `pages/` such as Examples or Gallery
   3) We need to do this as simple as possible cuz writing Sphinx has a huge learning curve. So,
   maintenance would be hard down the road.
   4) We might need to add multiple sphinx
   5) Altair has great docs that can be a good example for sphinx syntaxes
