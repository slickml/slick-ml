.. NOTES: 
   1) You can create a new page under `docs/pages/` in `.md` or `.rst` format
   2) You can add any required sphinx extension to `docs/conf.py`
   3) `docs/pages/releases.md` is a symlink to `CHANGELOG.md` in the root

.. TODOS:
   1) Once we add example notebooks, we can populate them below. I am not still sure on the format
   maybe we can have one examples pages and add the examples there as table with a permalink to
   github project repo. Anything we put in the doc, should be easy to maintain. So, we should
   maximize the use of permalinks and symlinks.

Welcome to SlickMLðŸ§ž Documentation!
===================================

**SlickML** is an open-source machine learning library written in Python aimed at accelerating the
experimentation time for a ML application. Data Scientists' tasks can often be repetitive such as
feature selection, model tuning, or evaluating metrics for classification and regression problems.
SlickML provides Data Scientists with a toolbox to quickly prototype solutions for a given problem
with minimal code.
